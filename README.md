# Backlink Full Path

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that shows the backlink's full path in the backlinks panel.

By default, Obsidian just shows the note name

Which might be confusing when you have notes with the same name in different folders.

This plugin shows the full name helping to identify the backlinks better
